My name is Michael Inglis and I’m a graduate from Otago Polytechnic with a Bachelor of Information Technology. 

I have a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese Language and Culture and a Diploma of Language in French. I spent two years living in Malaysia where I did some work as a research assistant and then taught English at a private language centre.

Upon returning to New Zealand from Malaysia, I enrolled in Victoria University of Wellington’s Information Studies programme, which focuses on library and archival studies. I graduated with a Postgraduate Diploma in Information Studies in 2011.

I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology at Otago Polytechnic in 2017. I have completed papers in a variety of areas including programming, web development, networking and systems administration.

After finishing my degree, I worked as a software developer intern at [Energy Link Limited](https://www.energylink.co.nz//) in Dunedin, New Zealand. My role involved monitoring and maintaining automated download processes, developing new software products and improving existing software products. We used C#, Microsoft SQL Server and also two programming languages developed in-house. Due to external factors, Energy Link is downsizing and my employment finished at the end of January 2019.
